Version 2.4
 - added:    new backup format (nbf) support. Actually nbf is nothing more than

             tool now if you like

             only first part (proably with user data) decoded (10-30% file
             coverage with available samples achieved)

Version 1.13

 - no functional change, only some internal code refactoring before publication
   of source code, because this is first version with full public access to the
   source code via SVN repository at sourceforge
 - readme.txt with short description, license.txt with GNU GPL license v3

             application to run under mono on linux), tested on Ubuntu 9.10

             to recover contacts, messages, calendar and bookmarks when classic
             parsing method fails, it could also work with damaged backup files
             or different types of files containing phone data in form of vcards
             (for example communication center cache files such as
             PCCSContact.db, PCCSSMS.db etc.)
